# My learning with PySpark music recommendation system

Hello, the challenge of this project is to improve the existing music recommendation system, but which only takes into account the genres of the songs. we will use clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. To do this, we will use some PySpark modules, such as SQL, to manipulate the data, and Machine Learning, which will allow the use of various tools aimed at clustering solutions.

As a result of our course project it will be really cool, we will create a function that, having a reference song, will return a playlist. This playlist will be presented with album covers and song names.
